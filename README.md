# The Background Color Web Page

A simple express application that set a background color and prints its running hostname.

This application was used to practice Docker, Kubernetes and Blue/Green (Red/Black) deployment.

The images for each color version (blue, green. red, black) are available as tags on <https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pfeiferv/bgapp>
